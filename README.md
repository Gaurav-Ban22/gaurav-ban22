### Hey, I'm SpellCore!

I'm a hacker, gamer, and pixelartist.

I love coding and developing games. Some of my work is in private repos, and some of my good projects aren't currently in repositories.
Gaming is definitely poggers. I love to play video games such as Minecraft, and I'm a nintendo enthusiast.
I made my profile picture! Pixel art is great!

Check out my profile! I have some cool repos there, are there are more to come!

Thanks!
