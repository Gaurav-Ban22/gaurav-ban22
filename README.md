### Hey, I'm SpellCore!

I'm a hacker, gamer, and pixelartist.

I am hopefully a good programmer who loves to code and learn new concepts (new langs and libraries and stuff lmao)

dark mode is best

I love coding and developing games. A lot of my work is in private repos.

Unity is my main tool for gamedev, one of my passions. If you ask me which engine is best I will immediately respond with Unity.

I am also a proud Ubuntu user.

Check out my profile! I have some cool repos there, and there are more to come!


Thanks!

P.S. By the way, please do not share any of my work without crediting me and asking me first.
